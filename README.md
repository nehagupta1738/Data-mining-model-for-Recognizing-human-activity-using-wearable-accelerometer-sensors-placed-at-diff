# Recognizing human activity using multiple wearable accelerometer sensors
#### Human Activity Recognition, is the problem of predicting what kind of activity a person is performing based on a signals detected by smartphone sensors on their waist.
#### Two types of sensors present in smartphones are:
#### 1. `Accelerometer`
#### 2. `Gyroscope`
#### Accelerometer measures acceleration and Gyroscope measures angular velocity.
